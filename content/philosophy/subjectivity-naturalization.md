title: Subjectivity and Naturalization

Experience has shown me that human beings have a tendency to "naturalize" their subjective judgements of the world- that is, they present those judgements as immutable (and axiomatically correct) truths of the world around them. This essay lays out why I think people do this, and how to avoid falling into this trap.

# Definitions

This essay deals with some of the technical minutae of words, so I'll lay them out at the outset. These definitions are pulled from [*Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary*](https://merriam-webster.com/), as of 2024-05-31:

> [**subjective**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subjective)
>
> **3a:** characteristic of or belonging to reality as perceived rather than as independent of mind

> [**objective**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objective)
>
> **1a:** expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations

> [**effective**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/effective)
>
> **1a:** producing a decided, decisive, or **desired** effect *(emphasis mine)*

# Judge, jury, and...

What is the difference between the following statements?

* "That light switch is on."
* "This brush is effective at combing my hair."

## Naturally, my dear

I've taken to calling the above process *naturalization*: a subconscious blurring of the lines between one's judgements and interpretations of the world, and the world itself.
