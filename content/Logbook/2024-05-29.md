- [An interesting article on DuckDB and its ability to query from multifarious sources](https://www.nikolasgoebel.com/2024/05/28/duckdb-doesnt-need-data.html).

- [An intentionally-broken DNS server for testing purposes](https://gitlab.rd.nic.fr/dns-testing-tools/ibdns)

- [A (very awful but functional) web app for making header images](https://blogcover.vercel.app/)

  - I've standardized on 1300x200 for these, using the default colors found in that app.

    - 1300x100 sounds like a nice header size for libraries.

- I've implemented a `./bootstrap.sh` command that can setup a machine to work on Panopticon. I think this'll be a
  common pattern for me going forward.

- I've found Vale to be a very nice companion as I write documentation- I plan on adding to more of my projects. The
  VSCode integration leaves a lot to be desired- it seems to over-scan things- but the `Alex`, `proselint`, and `Google`
  rules are a good combination.

- [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) has some nice annotations for commit messages.

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) also seems like a good thing to add to my work.

- Some awesome lists I want to get more info from:

  - [Quantified Self](https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self)

### `bin/web`

- [x] Consolidate the CSS I'm using from Super Traceroute into my own files.

    - I'm also working on converting all of this CSS into SCSS, using ideas and layouts from
    [CSS Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es) to try and make my styles more comprehensible.

### `lib/init`

- [x] Figure out OpenTelemetry integration and provider.

    - Alternatively, is it worth just installing [sybil](https://github.com/logv/sybil) and dumping data into it like I would with Scuba?

    - OK. I've decided that I don't like any of the available providers for telemetry, and I'm going to just write my own. In particular, I want to make something based on the concepts of `ctxlog`, so building up/nesting tags is important.

    - I still need to figure out where to dump this data to.
