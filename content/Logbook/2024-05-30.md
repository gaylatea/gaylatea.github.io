- [x] Deploy to the dev server.

### `@panopticon///bin/web`

- [x] Fix the size of the input textbox.

- [x] Change the request logger to use `@panopticon///lib/instrument.WithSpan`.

### `@panopticon///lib/data`

- [x] Figure out why migrations fail to run.

    - This was caused by `Migrate` closing the database even after successful runs. I've removed that and all is well. The migration source, in the embedded `io.FS`, doesn't get closed, which might leave some memory on the floor, but it's small enough that I don't really care right now.

### `@panopticon///lib/log`

![A demo of how instrument looks now](./2024-05-30-instrument.gif)

- [x] Add support for changing debug/trace mode at runtime.

- [x] Contextualize log lines with their parent span, if one exists.

- [x] Rename to `@panopticon///lib/instrument`.

- [x] Make the context carry values properly for `context.WithTimeout` and others.

- [x] Make the log output contain filename and line metadata.

- [x] Output JSON when the stream is not a TTY.

- [x] Add support for tracing.

### `@panopticon///lib/db`

- [x] Instrument queries.
