### `bin/web`

  - [x] Make the inputs actually use what the user entered.

    - [x] Lookup all the endpoints associated with the given domain.
  
    - There's a weird error that I'm running into when trying to run multiple domains at once- `pgx` is panicking in a way that I don't understand. I've verified that the query being run - `queryUpsertEndpoint` - should work as expected, but for some reason `pgx` isn't able to scan the rows?

      - It looks like this is related to the attempted parallelization. Maybe the queries are getting serialized into the same connection and it's messing with the scanning logic?

      - Honestly I don't think I need that right now, and it'll end up being implicitly parallelized in the worker anyways, so... I'll leave it alone for now.
