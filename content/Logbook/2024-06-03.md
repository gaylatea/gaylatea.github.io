- [ ] Add Nginx or some other reverse proxy to listen on the correct port.

- [ ] Demo for Mike.

- [ ] Run through and update docs for everything I've written in the last week.

- [ ] Create a `plz` alias to quickly run the entire dev setup at once.

- [ ] Figure out how to force the right `plz` version.

  - [ ] Submit a PR for the `homebrew-please` repo?

### `@panopticon///lib/data`

- [ ] Figure out why creating new domains/endpoints isn't working.

- [ ] Add `@panopticon///lib/instrument` tracing.

### `@panopticon///lib/instrument`

- [ ] Decide on support for pre-aggregated metrics.

  - The primary issue I can see is the huge cardinality that arises from how I handle `context` tags. That being said, there's definitely a useful idea in "hey let me keep track of some count that I know is important that is not necessarily an event".

- [ ] Buffer logs inside of spans for console output?

### `@panopticon///lib/queue`

- [ ] Add support for "finalizers" which run when a job is closed out by the queue.

### `@panopticon///bin/worker/task`

- [ ] Add code to handle the existing HSTS failure modes.

- [ ] Add a SERIALIZABLE transaction for potentially creating endpoints/domains/certs.

- [ ] Instrument the worker with spans.

- [ ] Thread debug and trace logging throughout the system.
